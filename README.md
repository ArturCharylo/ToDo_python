# ToDo_python

A simple ToDo application created to practice Python skills and expand my programming portfolio.

This directory contains three versions, a desktop app built with PySide6, a console app written in pure Python and a web version built with Vite + React + TypeScript, all connected to a Django REST backend. Depending on which one you wish to run, choose `desktop/` directory for the desktop version, `console/` directory for the console version or `web/` directory for the web version.

This project was built to practice structuring multi-layered Python applications (backend + desktop + CLI + web) and to demonstrate understanding of REST APIs, database migrations, and GUI design.

> Note: All the versions have their own tests if you wish to run them you can!

## 🆕 Recent Updates (2026)
- **Automated Environment:** Introduced a robust `start.sh` bash script that drastically improves Developer Experience (DX). It runs the API and Web frontend concurrently, automatically handles dependency installations (`poetry` & `npm`), runs database migrations, and safely cleans up ports and background processes on exit.
- **Modernization & Refactoring:** Ongoing process of splitting monolithic React structures into smaller, reusable components, and upgrading overall application security.

## 🚀 How to Start

### ⚡ Quick Start: Web + API (Linux / macOS / WSL)
The absolute easiest way to start the web application and backend API is by using the automated startup script. 

1. Give the script execution permissions (only needed once):
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ```
Run the application:

```Bash
./start.sh
```
This script will automatically check and install all required Python and Node.js packages, apply database migrations, and spin up both the Django API and the Vite React App. Press Ctrl+C in the terminal to gracefully stop all services and free the ports.

## 🛠️ Manual Start (Any OS)
API uses Django REST Framework for the API layer.
Requirements: Poetry must be installed. Python 3.10+ recommended.

If you prefer to start services manually, or if you want to run the Desktop or Console versions:

Start the API: Go to the api/src directory and run:

```Bash
poetry install
poetry run python manage.py runserver
```
Start a Client (Choose one):

Web version: Go to the web/ directory and run:

```Bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
Desktop version: Go to the desktop directory and run:

```Bash
poetry install
poetry run python main.py
```
Console version: Go to the console/ directory and run:

```Bash
poetry install
poetry run python ToDo.py
```

## 🐳 Docker Support
You can also run the entire app using Docker!

Build & Run with Docker Compose
Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

```Bash
cd docker
docker-compose up --build
```
This will spin up the following services:

- 🐍 backend (Django API)

- 🌐 web (Vite + React)

- 🖥️ desktop (PySide6 GUI)

- 💻 console (CLI version)

Note: Desktop and Console services run in containers and are mainly useful for debugging and CI — local use is still easier outside Docker.

To stop the containers, use Docker Desktop or run:

```Bash
docker-compose down
```
## 🗃️ API Setup
If you are not using start.sh or Docker, and running the project for the very first time manually, you need to set up the database:

```Bash
cd api/src
poetry run python manage.py makemigrations
poetry run python manage.py migrate
```
This will generate the database and create the required tables. All backend endpoints are located in api/src/api/views.py. The app provides standard CRUD operations via REST.

## 🧪 Tests

This project includes tests for each part of the application:

- **Web**: `web/src/App.test.tsx` – unit tests for frontend logic and UI
- **Desktop**: `desktop/tests/` – unit tests for GUI components and business logic
- **Console**: `console/` - unit tests for CLI logic
- **Backend**: `api/src/api/tests/` – Django tests for API endpoints

To run the tests, go to the corresponding directory and use:

```bash
# For web
npm run test

# For backend
poetry run python manage.py test

# For console
poetry run python test.py

# For desktop
poetry run pytest
```

## 🧠 About `App.tsx` (Web version)

The `App.tsx` file contains the web frontend and all the logic that handles API requests and responses.

- `App` - Main function responsible for running every other part of this code
- `fetchTasks` - gets the tasks from the API so that the data can be used in the rest of the code
- `handleSubmit` - function that handles code behaviour after user submits the form for adding tasks
- `displayTasks` - displays all the tasks that have been fetched from the API in the table on the web
- `AddTask` - handles adding a task via an API request
- `UpdateTask` - handles changing task status in the database via an API request („Done” ⇄ „Undone”)
- `DeleteTask` - handles deleting tasks from the database via an API request

## 🧠 About `main_window.py` (Desktop version)

The `main_window.py` file contains the main layout and logic of the app. It includes:

- All visual elements of the app based on PySide6.
- `load_tasks()` – Fetches tasks from the API, updates the list, and calculates completion statistics using `numpy`.
- `add_task()` – Handles UI logic and validation for adding a new task from the user input fields.
- `toggle_task_done(item)` – Asynchronously toggles the completion status of a task when double-clicked.
- `delete_selected_task()` – Deletes the currently selected task from the database via the API.
- `export_tasks_to_file()` – Implements file operations by exporting the current task list to a `.txt` or `.csv` file.

---

## 🧠 About `ToDo.py` (Console version)

The `ToDo.py` file contains the CLI logic and handles communication with the backend. It includes functions for API requests and the main application loop.

- `display_menu()` – Displays the menu and handles user input
- `load_data()` – Utility function for fetching data from the backend.
- `add_task()`, `display_tasks()`, `mark_task_as_done()`, `delete_task()` – Main task-handling functions that interact with the backend

## 🧪 Build & Run with Docker Compose

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

> You can install Docker Desktop here: [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up --build
```

This will spin up the following services:

- 🐍 backend (Django API)
- 🌐 web (Vite + React)
- 🖥️ desktop (PySide6 GUI)
- 💻 console (CLI version)

> Note: Desktop and Console services run in containers and are mainly useful for debugging and CI — local use is still easier outside Docker.

To Stop the container you can either do so manually in docker desktop or by:

```bash
docker-compose down *container-name*
```

## 🔄 GitHub Actions CI/CD

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at:

```bash
.github/workflows/docker-build.yml
```

This workflow automatically builds and validates all Docker images on every push to ensure your containers stay in a working state.
