# ToDo_python

ToDo app project to practice python skills and diversify my portfolio

To run this app you need to run py ToDo.py in your terminal once you are int the project directory

# ToDo.py

A main file of the program all code is written here
The file contains a function display_menu which is responsible for the main part of the UI and handles user choices
Functions load_data and save_data are helper functions to enable easy access to data from the json file
Rest of the functions add_task, display_tasks, mark_task_as_done, delete_task are functions that handle operations on the data and the file

# data.json

All the data generated will be stored here and all the data used by the code will be sourced from this file
